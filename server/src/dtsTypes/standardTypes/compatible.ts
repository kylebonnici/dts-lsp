This list of strings should be used by a client program for device driver selection. The property value consists of a concatenated list of null terminated strings, from most specific to most general. They allow a device to express its compatibility with a family of similar devices, potentially allowing a single device driver to match against several devices.`,
    `The recommended format is "manufacturer, model", where manufacturer is a string describing the name of the manufacturer (such as a stock ticker symbol), and model specifies the model number.`,
